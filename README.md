## Coop Plan

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Make sure to have a schedule for git. Keep separate branches for different pieces. Sync twice a day - 9am open meeting; 5pm closeout.

## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Leaders of each section have the most say on their portions. If there's technical conflict where one member's change may break another's portion, the designated team lead can mediate.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

If one person is taking the lead and not letting others contribute, the other team members can call them out. Escalate to instructor if the individual is not receptive to feedback.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

At sync meetings take the time to understand everyone's pieces. Each member will brief their progress, and ensure other members are on the same page prior to merging. Ensure all members understand not only how the code works, but why it was written that way and why that piece/module of the project exists.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

If timelines aren't being met, discuss reasons why with the individual and redistribute work load if necessary. We can also re-evaluate project scope if necessary. If the team feels that it is a case of another member not pulling their weight, try to mediate internally, confirm Team Agreement / working hours, and involve the instructor if unsuccessful.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Coin flip, and if anyone has a problem with the result, then bring problems to an instructor.

## Communication Plan

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

* 9 AM - 6 PM in Remo. Give a heads up if you have other plans.
  * 9am morning sync
  * 6pm closeout

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

* Remo for collab, Slack for other communication.

### How often will you take breaks?

* As many as we need. We won't track individual's work/breaks outside of the two meetings, barring any necessary unscheduled git merges.

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

* Reevaluate timeline, scope of the project, work distribution, working hours, work harder!

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

* No expectations to work outside of work hours unless decided by the team ahead of time to meet timeline goals. Must be consensus to extend hours.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

* Every meeting everyone must share their piece. If there are disagreements, the team will gather input from every member.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

* NO SHAMING!!
* Talk about the idea and not the person
* Reinforce the positive
* Provide an alternative if you disagree with a proposed idea/solution
